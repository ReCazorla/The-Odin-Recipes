    <p>Make perfect <strong>Napoletana Pizza</strong> at home with this classic recipe!</p>
    <p>Including a pizza dough recipe, topping suggestions, and step-by-step instructions with photos.</p>

    <p><em>Ingredients for the dough:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>800 gr of “00” flour</li>
        <li>2 gr of fresh brewer’s yeast</li>
        <li>10 gr of sugar</li>
        <li>500 gr of water</li>
        <li>25 gr of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Ingredients for the topping:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>100 gr of tomato pulp</li>
        <li>200 gr of Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP</li>
        <li>Basil</li>

    </ul>

    <p><em>Instructions:</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put half of the flour in the mixer bowl. With floured hands, crumble the brewer’s yeast inside.<br>
            The yeast must be put in the flour because it contains the sugars necessary for the yeast.</li>
        <li>Separately, dissolve the salt into water and pour it into the mixture.<br> Start kneading, after 1 minute
            addthe sugar, then, when it has been absorbed, add the rest of the flour.</li>
        <li>Make the dough sit for about ten minutes. Finally add the extra virgin olive oil and knead until absorbed.
        </li>
        <li>Place the dough on a floured surface and work with two hands kneading for about 5-10 minutes.<br>
            Put the dough in a glass bowl with a slightly oiled base, cover with a cloth and let it rise for about 30
            minutes in a warm place.<br>
            Take the dough again, form a loaf and divide it into about 6 pieces.<br>
            Make balls and put them under heat covered by a cloth, and let them rise for about 6-8 hours.</li>
        <li>After the dough has risen, bring the oven to max temperature and wait until the oven is hot.</li>
        <li>To shape the pizzas, spread them on a floured surface and push with your fingers 2-3 times forward then turn
            the pizza over and do the same on the other side.<br>
            The pizza will be thinner in the center and with a nice higher edge.</li>
        <li>Season the tomato with salt, a little extra virgin olive oil and a few basil leaves, and cut the mozzarella
            into strips.<br>
            Season the pizzas with a generous spoonful of tomato.<br>
            Spread it on the pizza with the spoon
            itself but without reaching the edge. Add the mozzarella, a few basil leaves and a drizzle of extra virgin
            olive oil<br> and bake each pizza by placing it on a pizza stone.<br>
            In this case it will take about 6-8 minutes.<br>
            Or bake in round trays and cook until golden brown.</li>

    <h2><em>Vegetarian Cesar Salad</em></h2>
    <img src="images/salad.jpeg" alt="Vegetarian Cesar Salad" height="auto" width="550"><br>
    <p>A delicious and tasty<strong>Vegetarian Salad</strong></p>
    <p>Here is a vegetarian tasty for the classic caesar salad. It's simple, quick and so delicious!</p>

    <p><em>Ingredients for the salad:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Croutons</li>
        <li>Permesan Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Ingredients for the dressing:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mayonnese</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Dijon Mustard</li>
        <li>Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Red Wine Vinegar</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
        <li>Water</li>

    </ul>
    <p><em>Instructions:</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, add all the ingredients for a caesar dressing.</li>
        <li>Whisk until well combined. Creamy caesar salad dressing is ready! Store it refrigerated until ready to use.
        </li>
        <li>First, cut the top wilted part of the lettuce. Discard it. Throw away the outermost layer of lettuce if it
            looks spoiled or spotted.</li>
        <li>Now make 4-5 slits lengthwise all around the lettuce.</li>
        <li>Chop the lettuce into bite-sized pieces starting from the leafy end and moving towards the core end. Discard
            the core end</li>
        <li>Place the chopped lettuce in a colander or a salad spinner. I am using a salad spinner here. Fill with cold
            water and add salt to it.<br>Leave the greens in cold salted water for 1-2 mins. It helps draw out many
            bugs. Rinse gently.</li>
        <li>Drain the water completely, and repeat the rinse cycle if needed depending on how dirty the lettuce is.</li>
        <li>Now dry the lettuce thoroughly. I like to use my salad spinner for this. Alternately you can also spread the
            washed drained lettuce leaves<br> on a paper towel and /or blot or pat dry with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Add the clean, dry lettuce to a large serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle generously with shredded parmesan cheese and crunchy croutons.</li>
        <li>Drizzle in the veg caesar dressing.</li>
        <li>Toss gently until lettuce is evenly coated.</li>

    <p><em>Ingredients:</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 sheet vegan puff pastry </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground flax meal + 5 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grapeseed oil , or preferred cooking oil</li>
        <li>½ medium onion , diced</li>
        <li>2 small carrots . diced </li>
        <li>2 stalks celery , diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic , minced or crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground sage</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>8 ounces mushrooms , minced or finely chopped</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons tamari sauce , low sodium (sub soy sauce)</li>
        <li>1 15 oz can chickpeas (garbanzo beans) , drained well but NOT rinsed</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted walnuts , ground into a course meal (measured whole)</li>
        <li>½ cup panko breadcrumbs , more if needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1.5 tablespoons vegan worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt , more to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cracked pepper , to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegan butter , melted</li>

    </ul>

    <p><em>Instructions:</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 °F (200 °C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the ground flax and water in a small bowl. Set aside for 10 min. It will thicken and gel up a bit.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Now add onion, celery, and carrots. Sauté until softened about
            6-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garlic, thyme, sage, and rosemary. Sauté for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add mushrooms and sauté until they soften and release their moisture about 5-7 minutes. You want the pan to
            be dry. Now add the tamari and cook for 1 minute.<em><strong><br>Remove from heat and set aside to cool for
                    10 minutes.</em></strong></li>
        <li>Add chickpeas to a large mixing bowl and mash with a potato masher. Don't over mash - just mash enough to
            break down whole chickpeas, but leave lots of texture.</li>
        <li>Now add the cooled mixture, breadcrumbs, walnut meal, flax mixture, Worcestershire, tomato paste, salt, and
            pepper.<br> Combine well with a spatula and use your hands if needed. Taste and add more seasoning if
            preferred.<br>(If the mixture seems too wet, you can add another ¼ cup of breadcrumbs or rolled oats - You
            should be able to form it with your hands easily) </li>
        <li>Using your hands, shape the mixture into a solid log that will fit in the middle of the pastry sheet (with a
            few inches of slack). Make sure log is packed well. </li>
        <li>Unroll puff pastry sheet and lay it over the baking sheet (or a flat surface if you need to roll it first).
            Place the loaf in the middle of the pastry sheet.<br> Pick up one side and wrap it over the loaf and repeat
            on the other side.<br>  Gently press to seal together (don't force if it doesn't close, just thin & lengthen the
            loaf or remove some mixture and form again).<em><strong><br> *If pastry doesn't seal easily, just lightly brush
                    a little non-dairy milk in that area and seal.</em></strong></li>
        <li>Now roll up the ends and press gently to seal. If you have a lot of extra length, you may want to trim the
            dough first before sealing.<br> Otherwise, the ends of the loaf will be very doughy. Flip the loaf over so
            the sealed edges are facing the baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Brush the top and sides with melted vegan butter. Using a sharp knife, gently make diagonal slits across the
            whole top of loaf about 1-inch apart.<br> Now repeat going the other direction to criss-cross slits (see
            process photos in post above). </li>
        <li>Place in the oven for 30-35 minutes until heated throughout and the pastry is golden brown. Let sit 10
            minutes before gently cutting with a sharp knife.</li>
